# DaggerRepresentatives
An example of how to add Dagger 2 to an existing application.

Dagger 2 is usually a popular topic in Android developer circles. Many of us have experimented with the library and earned an appreciation for what it can do. However, I believe most of us spend most of our time maintaining existing Android applications and the idea of adding Dagger 2 to an existing application can feel daunting. My goal with this example is to show how this might be done in your project. Each commit shows a progression. Slides are included in the repo.
